ðŸ”¥ **2025.2** I started my internship at DeepSeek, working towards AGI!

ðŸ”¥ **2025.1** I completed my internship at ByteDance. I am grateful to my wonderful mentor, Mingxuan Wang, and my colleagues. During my time there, I worked on an academic project involving [autoregressive diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07720) and a production project focused on an O1-style model [Doubao-AS1-preview](https://team.doubao.com/en/special/doubao_1_5_pro#:~:text=%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%BE%B9%E7%95%8C-,Doubao%20%E6%B7%B1%E5%BA%A6%E6%80%9D%E8%80%83%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F,-%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E6%98%AF).

ðŸ”¥ **2024.5** I started my internship at ByteDance's LLM team!

ðŸ”¥ **2024.4** We released [LEGENT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.18243). An Open Platform for Embodied Agents, the main contributor Zhili Cheng is awesome at unity programming! 

ðŸ”¥ **2024.4** We released the paper of [MiniCPM](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM) in [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06395). A small LLM with 2.4B non-embedding parameters that rivals Llama-13B or Mistral-7B.
